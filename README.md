The objective of my project plan is to create a recommendation system that will recommend movies to the user.  This will be done by following the project steps that were given to us during our data analytics course.

1.  Create a repository on GitHub with a ReadMe file, a gitingnore file, and a virtual environment that contains the necessary features that will be needed to complete the project.

2.  Next will be finding data by searching datasets through sources such as Kaggle and Google searches.

3.  The third step will be to use Python to explore the data.  This will be done through a Virtual Environment that will consists of features such as Visual Studio Code, Panda, and Numpy.

4.  At this stage we will figure out questions and answers such as what content the recommendation system will use.

5.  The data will be cleaned by removing and replacing unneccessary rows and columns using dropna and slicing.

6.  After this a final analysis should be made.  Other features that might be used could include Matplotlib if any visualations are to be used for the project.
